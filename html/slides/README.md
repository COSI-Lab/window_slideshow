# How to add slides
Slides are titled {index}.jpg. (ex. 0.jpg, 1.jpg, ...)

To add a slide, put any .jpg image in this directory and name it accordingly.

In general, slides should be 2560x1440, slides with different aspect ratios
will be displayed with letterboxing.

> Note: The slideshow will advance the index until an image cannot be loaded, 
> so files must be named sequentially. (ex. If the slides directory contains
> 0.jpg, 1.jpg, and 3.jpg, the slideshow will repeat after 1.jpg is displayed)
